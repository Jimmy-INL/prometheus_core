"""Public GET /.well-known/jwks.json -- the backend's own RS256 public keyset.

Lets agents verify platform-minted identity tokens without any private
material ever leaving the backend: an agent (including a third-party one)
points its JWKS_URL here instead of holding USER_IDENTITY_PUBLIC_KEY directly
(see docs/dev-docs/multi-user-setup.md). Not under /api -- JWKS is
conventionally served at the host root (RFC 7517; matches every agent's own
/.well-known/jwks.json in prometheus_api.agent.base). Unauthenticated by
design: a JWKS document is public key material only.

Serves every row in the signing_keys table, active or retired -- see
app/db/models.py::SigningKey's docstring for why retired keys aren't pruned
automatically (tokens minted before a rotation must stay verifiable).
