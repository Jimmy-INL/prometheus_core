"""App-facing mesh enrichment: populate mesh artifacts' ``json_body`` with a VTP manifest.

For every artifact the classifier routes to the ``"mesh"`` render hint, this resolves
the raw Exodus/STL bytes (reusing :func:`app.uri_resolver.resolve_to_local_path`),
converts them to ``.vtp`` timesteps + a manifest off the event loop (in a *subprocess*
pool, content-hash cached), and sets ``json_body`` to the exact prop shape
``frontend/src/viewers/mesh/MeshViewerElement.tsx`` reads. The ``.vtp`` files are served
by ``GET /api/artifacts/mesh/{dataset_id}/{filename}`` (see ``routers/artifacts.py``),
so ``baseUrl`` points there.

On any failure the artifact's ``json_body`` is left unset (``None``) so the frontend
adapter cleanly degrades to a file download — restoring rendering must never break a turn.

IMPORTANT: the VTK-dependent converter modules are imported lazily inside
:func:`_convert_sync` (which runs in a worker subprocess), so importing this module — as
``routers/artifacts.py`` and ``services/chat.py`` both do — never pulls in ``vtk``. The
offline backend test suite has no VTK installed, and with the conversion out-of-process
the web process never imports VTK at all.

WHY A SUBPROCESS AND NOT A THREAD: VTK is a large C++ library reached through Python
bindings. A segfault or an OOM kill inside it takes down the whole interpreter — which,
with a thread pool, is the web process, dropping every in-flight conversation on the
floor (the most plausible source of the unexplained backend restarts seen in dev). In a
child process the same crash costs exactly one artifact: :func:`_enrich_one` catches it
and the frontend adapter degrades that artifact to a file download.

    kills pool A, a new conversion builds pool B, and another job still on A then gets
    ``BrokenProcessPool``. Discarding "whatever is current" there shut down B with
    ``cancel_futures=True`` and cancelled unrelated conversions queued on it.

    A :class:`BrokenProcessPool` poisons the executor for *every* subsequent submit,

    it has to be replaced.

    The two failures worth naming:

    * :class:`BrokenProcessPool` — the worker died (VTK segfault, or the kernel

      took every live conversation with it. The pool is poisoned for all later submits,
      so it is dropped and the next call builds a fresh one.
    * timeout — a wedged conversion cannot be cancelled cooperatively, so the workers
      are killed. See :func:`_discard_executor` for why that can also abort a
      concurrent conversion.

    That abort arrives as a :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` — ``shutdown(cancel_futures=
    True)`` cancels the pending future ``run_in_executor`` wrapped — which, unlike a real
